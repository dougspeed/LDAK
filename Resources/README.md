The files RefSeq_GRCh37.txt and RefSeq_GRCh38.txt contain human gene annotations based on either the GRCh37 (hg19) or GRCh38 (hg38) genome assemblies. These files can be used when running LDAK-GBAT (www.dougspeed.com/ldak-gbat), LDAK-PBAT (www.dougspeed.com/ldak-pbat),  or Step 3 of LDAK-KVIK (www.dougspeed.com/ldak-kvik). The files paths.all16768 and paths.top6000 contain human pathway annotations obtained from the MSigDB database (either all 16,768 pathways, or a subset of 6000).

The file berisa.txt contains LD breakpoints for the human genome, and can be used when running MegaPRS (https://dougspeed.com/megaprs).

Please note that these files (and more) are also available at www.dougspeed.com/resources.
