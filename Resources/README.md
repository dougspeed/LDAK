The files RefSeq_GRCh37.txt and RefSeq_GRCh38.txt contain human gene annotations based on either the GRCh37 (hg19) or GRCh38 (hg38) genome assemblies. These files can be used when running LDAK-GBAT (www.dougspeed.com/ldak-gbat), LDAK-PBAT (www.dougspeed.com/ldak-pbat),  or Step 3 of LDAK-KVIK (www.dougspeed.com/ldak-kvik).

The file berisa.txt contains LD breakpoints for the human genome, and can be used when running MegaPRS (https://dougspeed.com/megaprs).
