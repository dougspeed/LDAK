The files RefSeq_GRCh37.txt and RefSeq_GRCh38.txt contain annotations for human genes using either the GRCh37 (hg19) or GRCh38 (hg38) genome assemblies, and can be used when running LDAK-GBAT (https://dougspeed.com/ldak-gbat) or Step 3 of LDAK-KVIK (https://dougspeed.com/ldak-kvik). Meanwhile, the file berisa.txt contains LD breakpoints for the human genome, and can be used when running MegaPRS (https://dougspeed.com/megaprs).

Please note that these files (and more) are available at https://dougspeed.com/resources.
